# Kong Blog Attacker!!

Kong Blog is a platform full of so-called beautiful images. However, it is so evil that one must spend a lot of money to join the group and watch the most exciting photos. Therefore, I'm gonna call myself publicness protector, and force Kong Blog to be as public as pornhub or other website like that.

The wechat id of Kong Blog is `ikongwuzicom` , but it has been silent for a long time. Its potato id is `ikongwuzi` , with the website published `https://findlifee.com` .

First, I grab all the urls for vips, and store them in a file. Then, I step over those urls, and look for the password through brute force. Now I'm running it on the server of my company, which has some problems in dealing with Chinese. There are lots of methods on the internet to solve it, but I can't change the config in the server. So the problem is still bothering me.

If you have some ideas, welcome to make issues.
